A simple streaming HTTP server using Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace, v 1.0

Created by Hans Sjunnesson (hans.sjunnesson@gmail.com)

Making an HTTP client which handles multipart/x-mixed-replace require some sort of reliable test source.
This simple HTTP server prints the time and date, every second, for a minute, then closes the connection.
